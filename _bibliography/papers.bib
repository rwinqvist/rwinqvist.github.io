  abstract    = {In the context of control systems, the integration of machine learning mechanisms has emerged as a key approach 
                for improving performance and adaptability. Notable progress has been made across several aspects of the control loop, 
                including learning-based techniques for system identification and estimation, filtering and denoising, and controller design. 
                This thesis delves into the rapidly expanding domain of learning in control, with a particular focus placed on learning-based 
                controllers and learning-based identification methods.
                
                The first part of this thesis is devoted to the investigation of Neural Network approximations of Model Predictive Control (MPC). 
                Model-agnostic neural network structures are compared to networks employing MPC-specific information, and evaluated in 
                terms of two performance metrics. The main novel aspect lies in the incorporation of gradient data in the training process, 
                which is shown to enhance the accuracy of the network generated control inputs. Furthermore, experimental results reveal that 
                MPC-informed networks outperform the agnostic counterparts in scenarios when training data is limited.
                
                In acknowledgement of the crucial role accurate system models play in in the control loop, the second part of this 
                thesis lends its focus to learning-based identification methods. This line of work addresses the important task of 
                characterizing and modeling dynamical systems, by introducing cooperative system identification techniques to enhance 
                estimation performance. Specifically, it presents a novel and generalized formulation of the Correctional Learning 
                framework, leveraging tools from Optimal Transport. The correctional learning framework centers around a teacher-student model, 
                where an expert agent (teacher) modifies the sampled data used by the learner agent (student), to improve the student's 
                estimation process. By formulating correctional learning as an optimal transport problem, a more adaptable framework is achieved, 
                better suited for estimating complex system characteristics and accommodating alternative intervention strategies.},

  title={Optimal Transport for Correctional Learning}, 
  abstract={The contribution of this paper is a generalized formulation of correctional learning using optimal transport, 
  which is about how to optimally transport one mass distribution to another. Correctional learning is a framework developed 
  to enhance the accuracy of parameter estimation processes by means of a teacher-student approach. In this framework, an expert agent, 
  referred to as the teacher, modifies the data used by a learning agent, known as the student, to improve its estimation process. 
  The objective of the teacher is to alter the data such that the student's estimation error is minimized, subject to a fixed intervention budget. 
  Compared to existing formulations of correctional learning, our novel optimal transport approach provides several benefits. 
  It allows for the estimation of more complex characteristics as well as the consideration of multiple intervention policies for the teacher. 
  We evaluate our approach on two theoretical examples, and on a human-robot interaction application in which the teacher's role is to 
  improve the robots performance in an inverse reinforcement learning setting.},

  title={A Teacher-Student Markov Decision Process-based Framework for Online Correctional Learning}, 
  abstract={A classical learning setting typically concerns an agent/student who collects data, or observations, 
            from a system in order to estimate a certain property of interest. Correctional learning is a type of 
            cooperative teacher-student framework where a teacher, who has partial knowledge about the system, 
            has the ability to observe and alter (correct) the observations received by the student in order to 
            improve the accuracy of its estimate. In this paper, we show how the variance of the estimate of the 
            student can be reduced with the help of the teacher. We formulate the corresponding online 
            problem – where the teacher has to decide, at each time instant, whether or not to change the observations 
            due to a limited budget – as a Markov decision process, from which the optimal policy is derived using 
            dynamic programming. We validate the framework in numerical experiments, and compare the optimal online policy with the one from the batch setting.},

  title={On Training and Evaluation of Neural Network Approaches for Model Predictive Control}, 
  abstract = {The contribution of this paper is a framework for training and evaluation of Model Predictive Control (MPC)
             implemented using constrained neural networks. Recent studies have proposed to use neural networks with differentiable 
             convex optimization layers to implement model predictive controllers. The motivation is to replace real-time optimization in 
             safety critical feedback control systems with learnt mappings in the form of neural networks with optimization layers. 
             Such mappings take as the input the state vector and predict the control law as the output. 
             The learning takes place using training data generated from off-line MPC simulations. 
             However, a general framework for characterization of learning approaches in terms of both model 
             validation and efficient training data generation is lacking in literature. In this paper, 
             we take the first steps towards developing such a coherent framework. We discuss how the learning problem has 
             similarities with system identification, in particular input design, model structure selection and model validation. 
             We consider the study of neural network architectures in PyTorch with the explicit MPC constraints implemented as a 
             differentiable optimization layer using CVXPY. We propose an efficient approach of generating MPC input samples subject 
             to the MPC model constraints using a hit-and-run sampler. The corresponding true outputs are generated by solving the 
             MPC offline using OSOP. We propose different metrics to validate the resulting approaches. Our study further aims to explore 
             the advantages of incorporating domain knowledge into the network structure from a training and evaluation perspective. 
             Different model structures are numerically tested using the proposed framework in order to obtain more insights in the properties of 
             constrained neural networks based MPC.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the problem of controller identification given the data from a linear quadratic 
  Model Predictive Controller (MPC) with constraints. We propose an approach for learning MPC that explicitly 
  uses the gradient information in the training process. This is motivated by the observation that recent 
  differentiable convex optimization MPC solvers can provide both the optimal feedback law from the state to 
  control input as well as the corresponding gradient. As a proof of concept, we apply this approach to explicit MPC (eMPC), 
  for which the feedback law is a piece-wise affine function of the state, but the number of pieces grows rapidly 
  with the state dimension. Controller identification can here be used to find an approximate low complexity functional 
  approximation of the controller. The eMPC is modelled using a Neural Network (NN) with Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs), 
  since such NNs can represent any piece-wise affine function. A key motivation is to replace on-line solvers with neural 
  networks to implement MPC and to simplify the evaluation of the function in larger input dimensions. We also study 
  experimental design and model evaluation in this framework, and propose a hit-and-run sampling algorithm for input design. 
  The proposed algorithms are illustrated and numerically evaluated on a second order MPC problem.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
